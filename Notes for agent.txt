### Notes for agent

The planet info tiles should auto size to the amount of text inside. Mercury has a ton of blank space in the first tile. 

Have a option to hide the planets not in retrograde on the front page. This should be the preset when folks first open the app. 

Make the tiles square, still only one column. 

### Notes for future functionality and ideas:

What does the planet mean astrologically (what it governs). What does it mean when in retrograde. 

Include links for deeper effects to the signs. Eventually include on it's own. 

Plug in birth information, highlight most affected + full relational descriptions.

Menu bar (3 bars) functionality (need to program)
